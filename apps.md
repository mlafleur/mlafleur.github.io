# Image Importer

Image Importer provides an enhanced photo importation over the default Photos app included with Windows 8.1. Specifically it adds two features previously available in Windows Essentials Live Gallery - the ability to import files into folders by Date Taken and remove files from the source media when completed. I developed this utility for my personal use but decided to publish it after hearing others in the community looking for these features.
