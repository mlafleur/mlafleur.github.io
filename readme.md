# The World According to Marc

This repository holds my person blog. This blog has lived on many systems over the years and currently has content dating back to 2003. While I technical y started writing several years early, those original posts are lost to time at this point. Unfortunatly I was only able to recover posts that began after migrating to https://weblogs.asp.net. 

I'm always interest in hearing from readers, particularly where I have technical errors or outdated guidance on here. This is frankly why I have move to GitHub and Jekyll. If you see something wrong, outdated or just frankly confusing then please feel free to open an Issue. Or better yet, fix it yourself and send me a pull request. I would love to collaborate!
